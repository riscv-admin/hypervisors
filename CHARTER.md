# Hypervisors SIG Charter

The Hypervisors SIG has the responsibility to develop a long-term strategy,
ensure continuity of strategy across all activities, and provide oversight
of execution among the various groups.

The scope of the Hypervisor Software SIG is:

1. Coordinate progress on various open-source hypervisors (such as KVM,
   Xen, Xvisor, Bao, etc).
2. Coordinate progress on various open-source hypervisor tools (such as
   QEMU KVM, KVMTOOL, RustVMM, Xen tools, Libvirt, etc).
3. Discuss ideas about improving functionality, efficiency, and security
   of RISC-V virtualization support across open-source hypervisors.
4. Review and contribute to platform specification and SBI specification
   from a virtualization perspective.
5. Review upcoming ISA/non-ISA specifications which have hardware
   virtualization support in some form.
6. Develop a RISC-V hypervisor gap list and prioritize closure items.
7. Coordinate with the Priv IC, Software HC, Platform HSC and other
   committees as needed to create TGs to address hypervisor needs.
8. Create and execute a strategy for outreach to proprietary hypervisors.
